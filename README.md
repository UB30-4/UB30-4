# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

## About Me
Hi there! I'm Emmanuella Ubokabasi, a frontend developer with a passion for creating user-friendly and visually appealing web applications. I also have knowledge of full-stack development, allowing me to work on various layers of the application stack. In addition, I have experience in developing projects using React Native, enabling me to build mobile applications for both iOS and Android platforms.

Apart from my coding adventures, I have a keen interest in music. Drumming is not only a hobby but also a creative outlet for me. I find rhythm and beats fascinating, and they often inspire my approach to problem-solving in software development. Additionally, I am a mental health enthusiast, strongly believing in the importance of well-being and creating inclusive and accessible applications for all users.

## Repository Highlights
Here are some notable projects I have worked on:

### My Personal Blog: 
With Next.js, the blog is built to be performant and scalable, providing an immersive web experience for visitors. GraphQL is utilized for efficient data retrieval, while Hygraph CMS allows for seamless content management and delivery.(https://github.com/UB30-4/ubcodescms_blog).
As a web developer, I share insightful topics, development tips, and tutorials to inspire personal growth and empower others to grow in their careers. I also enjoy exploring ways to promote positive mental health, discussing books, and sharing knowledge with others. I hope to inspire you to pursue your passions, learn new things, and care for your mental health. Check out ubcodesblog.com

### Job Finder App:
The job finder app I developed using React Native and Expo Go is a versatile platform that enables users to discover and apply for job opportunities based on their preferences. By leveraging the power of React Native, the app delivers a seamless and native-like experience across both iOS and Android devices.https://github.com/UB30-4/ubjobfinder_rectnative.git

### 3D products customizer: 
The 3D product customizer I developed is an innovative web application that allows users to personalize and customize products in a three-dimensional environment. It provides a dynamic and interactive experience where users can modify various aspects of a product, such as colors, textures, materials, and even add custom engravings or designs.
One of the key challenges encountered during the development process was implementing the 3D rendering and interaction features. This involved integrating a robust 3D engine or library, such as Three.js or Babylon.js, to render the customizable product and enable real-time manipulation.https://github.com/UB30-4/threejs_3dshirt-customizer.git
